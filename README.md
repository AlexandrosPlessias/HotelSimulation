# HotelSimulation

The implementation of the simulation of a hotel's room reservation system and our familiarity with the basic functions of java such as classes (Client, Room, Floor, Hotel), overloaded methods (setRoomData, searchRoom). In the Logo method we dynamically display the size of the hotel in Text Art (eg NUM_FLOORS = 5, 5 storey hotel). In our simulation we have a 4-storey hotel with 6 rooms on each floor which will operate for 5 days  with a random number of customers from 0 to 8 per day and with a probability of 1/3 = 33.333% the customer can request a floor.
